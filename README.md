Assuming we got a contract from the BCS to write a Currency exchange program, the program will accpet 3 input, amount of  currency to be exchanged from the customer, currency code for the input currency, currency code for the output currency, our task is to make use of this three input parameter to make a program, that will do the buy-in function with buy-in rate, and sell-out function with sell-out rate, our goal is to include 15-20 type of different currencies. And automatize the slow currency exchange process. If possbile to finish before deadline we will make the program automatically to research data on the internet and to be able to use the up-to-date data itself, for every transaction.
